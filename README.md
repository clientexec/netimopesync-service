# About the Netim Ope sync service
This plugin is part of the domain name registrar plugin for Netim in ClientExec.

For many tlds, and especially ccTlds, the management is manual or not in realtime. Nevertheless, ClientExec does not know the result of all operations, in particular those that are processed asynchronously. 
Synchronization of asynchronous operations must therefore be handled separately.

This automation service is executed to check all pending requests at Netim in order to approve them in ClientExec. It is therefore mandatory to enable it in order to manage some tlds.
